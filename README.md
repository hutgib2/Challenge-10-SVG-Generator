## Description

This project created a Node.js command-line application that allowed user input to generate a unique logo and which is saved an SVG file. The application enables the user to choose color, text, and shape to generate a logo and then to save the SVG as a a file.

## Installation

The application uses Jest,  a JavaScript Testing Framework which runs unit tests to check code, as well as  Inquirer, an NPM package that captures user input in CLI applications. Inquirer formats questions and returns answers from the user which are then accessed by a promise function.

## Usage

 Use node index.js to initiate the application within the terminal.  A series of questions are then enabled as follows: the user responds to the questions in the terminal.
-Enter text up to 3 Characters  - Enter text color ( use color keyword or hexadecimal number) - Enter a shape( select circle, triangle or square) - Enter the color of the shape (use color keyword or hexadecimal number). 
Once the questions are done an SVG file is created : logo.svg .  To preview the logo, the user checks the logo in the browser.
